### **Implementation Approach**

1. **Core Module**

   * Holds reusable utilities, constants, themes, and localization provider.
   * Ensures consistent behavior and styling across the app.

2. **Feature Modules**

   * Each feature is isolated with its own `data`, `domain`, `presentation`, and optional `localization` folder.
   * Makes the app scalable and easier to maintain or extend.

3. **Shared Components**

   * Contains reusable components/widgets used across multiple feature modules.

4. **Localization**

   * Strings are provided via a central provider in `core/localization`.
   * Each feature can have its own localization file.

5. **Testing**

   * Unit tests in `test/` ensure business logic correctness.
   * Widget / integration tests ensure UI and feature flows are working correctly.

## Initialization & Feature Usage

1. Initialize core modules (constants, themes, localization) at app start.
2. Import required feature module into navigation or main app file.
3. Use shared components/widgets wherever needed.
4. Add new features by creating a new folder under `features/` following the same `data-domain-presentation-localization` structure.
